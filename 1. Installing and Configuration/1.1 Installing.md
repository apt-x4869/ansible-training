# Installing

```bash
Ansible is installed only on one system called Control Node which manages other systems called Managed Nodes using SSH(in linux) & WinRM(in Windows).
```

For Apt based system:

`$ apt-get install python3 python3-pip3`

For Yum based system:

$ `yum install python3 python3-pip3`

After installing Python and Pip3, we can now install ansible with pip3:

$ `pip3 install ansible`
