# Configure Ansible

Verify Installation:

`$ ansible --version`

Output of this will be like this:

```
ansible 2.9.13
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/home/codespace/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /home/codespace/.local/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.8.3 (default, May 20 2020, 17:43:52) [GCC 6.3.0 20170516]
  ```

* As you can see global config file is set to None

* By default ansible uses its config file located at **/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg** ( if ansible.cfg is not found at Home Directory and at Current Working Directory)

## So lets create the default config file

You can use any editor to create /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file 

```bash
[defaults]
inventory = ./inventory
remote_user = user
ask_pass = false

[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = false
```
