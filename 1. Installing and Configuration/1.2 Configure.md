# Configure Ansible

Verify Installation:

`$ ansible --version`

Output of this will be like this:

  ```bash
  ansible 2.9.13
    config file = None
    configured module search path = ['/home/codespace/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
    ansible python module location = /home/codespace/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/ansible
    executable location = /home/codespace/.local/bin/ansible
    python version = 3.8.3 (default, May 20 2020, 17:43:52) [GCC 6.3.0 20170516]
  ```

* As you can see global config file is set to None

* By default ansible uses its config file located at **/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg** ( if ansible.cfg is not found then it searches at Home Directory and then at Current Working Directory)

## So lets create the default config file

You can use any editor to create /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file

```bash
[defaults]
inventory = /home/codespace/workspace/ansible-training/1. Installing and Configuration/hosts.txt
remote_user = user
ask_pass = false

[privilege_escalation]
become = true
become_method = sudo
become_user = root
become_ask_pass = false
```

### What is an **Inventory**?

A static inventory file is a text file that specifies the managed hosts that Ansible targets. You
can write this file using a number of different formats, including INI-style or YAML.

Simple example:

  ```bash
  192.168.0.101
  192.168.0.201
  192.168.0.123
  192.168.0.103
  ```

  Let's create our own inventory file:
  /home/codespace/workspace/ansible-training/1. Installing and Configuration/hosts.txt

  ```bash
  104.209.237.166 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/workspace/private_key.txt ansible_connection=ssh
  ```

Here we have added extra info to inventory

* ansible_user : The default ssh user name to use.
* ansible_ssh_private_key_file : The location of ssh private key.
* ansible_connection : Connection type to the host. SSH protocol types are smart, ssh or paramiko.

If you want to login into using password you have to use ansible_ssh_pass keyword to specify password.

Note: Don't forget to update you inventory in ansible.cfg.

Run following command to list your hosts:
  
```bash
$ ansible all --list-host
hosts (1):
  104.209.237.166
```

Run the following command to check connection with host

```bash
$ ansible all -m ping
104.209.237.166 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```
